## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=TRUE}

# Convert date column to Date type
Motor_accidents$CRASH.DATE <- as.Date(Motor_accidents$CRASH.DATE)

# Extract day of the week
Motor_accidents$Daysoftheweek <- weekdays(Motor_accidents$CRASH.DATE)

# Select relevant columns
Motor_accidents2<- Motor_accidents %>%
  select(BOROUGH, CRASH.DATE, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, CONTRIBUTING.FACTOR.VEHICLE.1, VEHICLE.TYPE.CODE.1,Daysoftheweek)


# Filter out rows with missing values in key columns
Motor_accidents2 <- Motor_accidents2 %>%
  filter(!is.na(BOROUGH), 
         !is.na(LATITUDE), 
         !is.na(LONGITUDE), 
         !is.na(CRASH.DATE), 
         !is.na(VEHICLE.TYPE.CODE.1), 
         !is.na(CONTRIBUTING.FACTOR.VEHICLE.1))

#removing Rows that does not have boroughs 
Motor_accidents2 <- Motor_accidents2 %>%
  filter(!is.na(BOROUGH) & BOROUGH != "")

#First, for data preparation, I used the as.Date function to convert the crash.date column from character to date format. I then selected the columns I wanted and subsetted the data. Next, I removed the NAs from those columns and finally removed rows that did not list a borough.


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
#Analyze accidents by Borough 

# Count accidents by borough and percentage
borough_counts <- Motor_accidents2 %>%
  group_by(BOROUGH) %>%
  summarise(
    Accident.count = n(),
    Percentage = (n() / nrow(Motor_accidents2)) * 100
  )

# Visualization
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(borough_counts, aes(x = BOROUGH, y = Percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Accidents Percentage by Borough", x = "Borough", y = "Percentage of Accidents")

# I created a borough count to total the number of accidents per borough and provide the percentage breakdown. The results were as follows: Bronx had 41,788 (16.34%), Brooklyn had 83,901 (32.82%), Manhattan had 48,857 (19.11%), Queens had 71,345 (27.90%), and Staten Island had 9,710 (3.79%). From the bar plot, we see that Brooklyn has the highest number of accidents, followed by Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, and lastly, Staten Island.


```




```{r pressure2, echo=TRUE}

#day_counts and percentages 
days_counts <- Motor_accidents2 %>%
  group_by(Daysoftheweek) %>%
  summarise(
    Accident.count = n(),
    Percentage = (n() / nrow(Motor_accidents2)) * 100
  )


# Visualization
ggplot(days_counts, aes(x = reorder(Daysoftheweek, -Percentage), y = Percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "green") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Accidents by Day of the Week", x = "Day of the Week", y = "Percentage of Accidents") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# I then wanted to analyze whether certain days had more accidents. From the visualization, Tuesday had the highest number of accidents with 40,628 (15.89%), followed by Thursday with 38,091 (14.90%), Sunday with 38,044 (14.88%), Friday with 36,307 (14.20%), Saturday with 35,642 (13.94%), Wednesday with 33,965 (13.28%), and lastly Monday with 32,924 (12.88%).


```



```{r pressure3, echo=TRUE}

#day_counts and percentages 
Car_accident_factor <- Motor_accidents2 %>%
  group_by(CONTRIBUTING.FACTOR.VEHICLE.1) %>%
  summarise(
    Accident.count = n(),
    Percentage = (n() / nrow(Motor_accidents2)) * 100
  ) %>%
  filter(Accident.count > 10000)  # Filter for counts greater than 10,000

ggplot(Car_accident_factor, aes(x = reorder(CONTRIBUTING.FACTOR.VEHICLE.1, -Percentage), y = Percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "green") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Accidents by Contributing Factor", x = "Contributing Factor", y = "Percentage of Accidents") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


# I then wanted to explore the factors that caused the accidents. Since this is a large dataset, I focused on those with a count of 10,000 or more. The visualization showed that 'unspecified' had the highest number of accidents, with 66,461 (26.00%), followed by 'driver inattention/distraction' with 61,550 (24.08%), 'failure to yield right of way' with 19,396 (7.58%), 'following too closely' with 14,604 (5.71%), 'backing unsafely' with 13,724 (5.36%), 'passing too closely' with 11,540 (4.51%), and 'passing or lane usage improper' with 10,793 (4.22%).
